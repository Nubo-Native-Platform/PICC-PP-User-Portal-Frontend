# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please **do not open a public issue**. Email **contribution@nubons.com** with a
description, impact, and reproduction steps. We aim to acknowledge within 5
working days.

## No secrets in the repository
This repository must never contain secrets, API tokens, passwords, private keys,
`.env` files, or deployment credentials. Configuration is supplied at runtime
via environment variables. If you spot a committed secret, report it privately
using the address above so it can be rotated and purged.
